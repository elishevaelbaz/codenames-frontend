Codenames is a multiplayer single page application (SPA) based on [Czech Games's Codenames](https://codenamesgame.com/) where users compete by guessing words from the board based on their teammateâ€™s one-word clues.

Players can invite friends to play with them by giving them their unique room code.  

### Basic rules:

Players split into 2 teams, orange and purple.  
Each team designates a 'spymaster' who will be giving clues to their teammates for the entire round. 
The spymasters of each team click 'spymaster view' on their own screen to see which words they will attempt to get their teammates to guess.

The spymasters from each team take turns to provide a one-word clue and the number of cards they feel it relates to. Using this clue, the other players on the team must pick which word cards from the board they think the spymaster is hinting at. 

If a player chooses a card that doesnâ€™t correspond to one of their own, that teamâ€™s turn instantly ends. Any cards corresponding to the opponent team, result in the opposing team scoring. If the hidden bomb (red card) is chosen, the active team immediately loses the game. 
Otherwise, the winning team is whichever side successfully guesses all their words first.
